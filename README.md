## Zsh

For this customization, you'll need **Zsh**. If you're using Kali Linux or macOS, Zsh is installed by default. To check if Zsh is your current shell, use the following command:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If Zsh is not installed, run the following command on your Debian-based Linux OS:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

After installation, set Zsh as the default shell:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

Now Zsh is installed. Close your terminal and reopen it with Zsh.

## Install Oh My Zsh

To set up Zsh themes, install **Oh My Zsh** by running:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

---

## Install Powerlevel10k

Once Oh My Zsh is installed, install the **Powerlevel10k** theme:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Edit your `.zshrc` file to set Powerlevel10k as the theme:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Change the `ZSH_THEME` line to:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

Save the file and restart your terminal.
